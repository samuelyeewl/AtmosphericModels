The Kurucz 1993 models can be retrieved from
[here](http://ssb.stsci.edu/cdbs/tarfiles/synphot4.tar.gz).

The models are organized into folders `k[pm]ZZ`, where ZZ is the metallicity
(without a decimal point), with p or m corresponding to positive and negative.
Solar metallicity is represented as p00.

Within each folder, the files are organized as `k[pm]ZZ_TTTT.fits`, where TTTT
is the effective temperature (can be 4 or 5 digits).
